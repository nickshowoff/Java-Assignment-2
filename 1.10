1.10 (Average speed in miles) Assume a runner runs 14 kilometers in 45 minutes and
30 seconds. Write a program that displays the average speed in miles per hour.
(Note that 1 mile is 1.6 kilometers.)

public class question4 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("The average speed in miles per hour is equal to");
     System.out.println((14.0/1.6)/(45.5/60));
     

  }
}
