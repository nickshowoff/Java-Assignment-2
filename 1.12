1.12 (Average speed in kilometers) Assume a runner runs 24 miles in 1 hour, 40 minutes,
and 35 seconds. Write a program that displays the average speed in kilometers per
hour. (Note that 1 mile is 1.6 kilometers.)

public class question4 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("The average speed is equal to");
     System.out.println(24*1.6/(1+40/60+35/60/60));
     System.out.println("kilometers per hour");
  }
}
